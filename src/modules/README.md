# GoZen modules
GoZen modules are scene's you make outside of GoZen in another Godot project and you can use them within the GoZen video editor. For this all you need to do is create a folder called `modules` in `res://` and have all your parts necessary to run inside of a subfolder in `res://modules/`. Name the subfolder in lowercase characters and without spaces.
For exporting your module, all you need to do is go to `Project` -> `Export...`, create a preset for your OS, don't worry too much about the settings and click on `Resources`. In here for Export Mode you choose `Export selected scenes (and dependencies)`.
## Requirements
Your module must have a scene and an instance of the PCK resource.
